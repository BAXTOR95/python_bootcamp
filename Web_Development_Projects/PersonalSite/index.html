					<h3>Technical Proficiency and Innovation</h3>
					<p>
						My journey into the world of software development began during my
						university studies, where I delved deeply into programming and
						technology. Over the years, I've developed a strong proficiency in
						several key technologies, including Django, Angular, React, and
						HTMX. This diverse skill set has equipped me to tackle a wide range
						of development projects, pushing the boundaries of what's possible
						in software engineering.

					<h3>Experience Across Industries</h3>
					<p>
						My professional experiences, notably including a significant tenure
						at Citi, have exposed me to the nuances of software development in a
						corporate setting. At Citi, I was involved in projects that required
						not only technical expertise but also a keen understanding of
						business processes and client needs. This role sharpened my ability
						to develop software that is not only technically sound but also
						aligned with business goals.

					<h3>Foundational Education and Continuous Learning</h3>
					<p>
						My university studies laid the groundwork for my career in systems
						engineering and software development. The rigorous curriculum and
						hands-on projects prepared me for the challenges of the tech
						industry. Beyond formal education, I am committed to continuous
						learning, constantly updating my skills to keep pace with
						technological advancements. This dedication ensures that I bring the
						most current and effective solutions to my work.

					<h3>Solving Complex Technical Challenges</h3>
					<p>
						I excel at diagnosing and solving complex technical problems, a
						skill that has been crucial in my roles across different sectors. My
						methodical approach to debugging and problem-solving ensures that
						issues are not just temporarily fixed but are resolved in a way that
						strengthens the overall system. This capability has made me a
						valuable asset to my teams and projects.
